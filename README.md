# Networked Robotics Systems,Cooperative Control and Swarming final Project
## Done under the guidance of Prof. Ludovic Righetti at NYU Tandon School of engineering

## Introduction

The following program is an implementation of SWARM of robots using a distributed control 
law to achieve a task from six robots

### Compile Dependencies:

* Python 3.6
* Python Pybullet
* Numpy Library

### Run:

Create a new project from the given files. 
 
```
run_simulation.py 
```

## Efficiency of code:
Tested on Intel Core i9-8950HK with a Nvidia 1050 Ti GPU

+ The algorithm is iterative and quite resource expensive.

## Algorithms
+ Formation control: translation invariant case
